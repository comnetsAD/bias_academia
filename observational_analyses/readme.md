# Data and code to reproduce study 2 and study 4

To reproduce the results reported in our manuscript, execute the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/`. Each notebook is self-contained so they can be executed in any order. Within each notebook, the cells have to be executed sequentially. The output figures are stored in `figures/`. 

The datasets required to reproduce the results are stored in several different direoctories, which you should set to a local directory on your own machine before trying to reproduce the results. `DIR` is either `../data/study_2_data` or `../data/study_4_data`, and you should not have to change this. `LARGEFILE` is `../data/large` by default. While in principle you do not need to change its value, you should remember to download large data files from [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Causal_evidence_of_racial_and_institutional_biases_in_accessing_paywalled_articles_and_scientific_data/30126952?file=57963016) and store them in `data/large`. You also need to download a copy of the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) dataset and store them on your machine, the path of which should be set as the `OPENALEX` variable. Finally, you also need a local copy of the [SciSciNet](https://github.com/kellogg-cssi/SciSciNet) dataset, the path of which should be set as the `SCISCINET` variable. Note that our analysis relies on SciSciNet v1, but you may also use the latest SciSciNet v2, which may yield slightly different results compared what we report in our manuscript.
