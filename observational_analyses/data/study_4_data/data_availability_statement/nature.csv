The Genomics England data set can be accessed by joining the community of academic and clinical scientist via the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP),https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-gecip/. To join a GeCIP domain, the following steps have to be taken: 1. Your institution has to sign the GeCIP Participation Agreement, which outlines the key principles that members of each institution must adhere to, including our Intellectual Property and Publication Policy. 2. Submit your application using the relevant form found at the bottom of the page (https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/join-a-gecip-domain/). 3. The domain lead will review your application, and your institution will verify your identity for Genomics England and communicate confirmation directly to Genomics England. 4. Your user account will be created. 5. You will be sent an email containing a link to complete Information Governance training and sign the GeCIP rules (https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GeCIP-Rules_29-08-2018.pdf). Completing the training and signing the GeCIP Rules are requirements for you to access the data. After you have completed the training and signed the rules, you will need to wait for your access to the Research Environment to be granted. 6. This will generally take up to one working day. You will then receive an email letting you know your account has been given access to the environment, and instructions for logging in (for more detail, see:https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/join-a-gecip-domain/). Details of the data access agreement can be retrieved fromhttps://figshare.com/articles/GenomicEnglandProtocol_pdf/4530893/5.

The request will be reviewed independently by the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU) Directors at University of Birmingham in discussion with the Chief Investigator and relevant Trial Management Group and independent Trial Steering Committee. In making their decision the Director’s Committee will consider the scientific validity of the request, the qualifications of the Research Group, the views of the Chief Investigator, Trial Management Group and Trial Steering Committee, consent arrangements, the practicality of anonymizing the requested data and contractual obligations. Where the CRCTU Directors and appropriate Trial Committees are supportive of the request, and where not already obtained, consent for data transfer will be sought from the Sponsor of the trial before notifying the applicant of the outcome of their request. It is anticipated that applicants will be notified of a decision within 3 months of receipt of the original request. The results published here are based in part on data generated by TCGA pilot project established by the NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute.
